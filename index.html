        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
       <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> 
       game." He lifted his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why would I 
       want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"

                      <article>
                          Hey everyone! My name is David and I have been learning how to code!. Before I was learning these new skills, I was at a very comfortable job where I was making enough. We could have continued on living the same lifestyle we
                          (my wife Laura and I) had been living, but there was a feeling of not being able to reach my full potential in my current position. I felt that i was not being challenges enough and certainly did not love the job. I had felt
                          this way for some time now, but I was not sure what direction I wanted to go.

                          At the time, I was also planning a wedding. It is about a month away from the big day, and I am on my Bachelor Party trip. Turns out, 3 of the 7 groomsman are <strong>COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS</strong>. One of them was my college
                          roommate. I had watche him complete some assignments while in college, and while it seemed interesting, I never though it would be something I could comprehend. I have never been very technologically advanced. Then I hear from
                          my cousins, Mikey and Charlie that they are also <strong>COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS</strong>. I had no clue! They referred me to a progream named <a href="https://truecoders.io/">TrueCoders</a>. This has led me to this point now, where
                          I feel I can find a lucrative job as a backend developer.
